# 🧑‍💼 Predicting Hiring Decisions in Recruitment Data

This machine learning project focuses on predicting whether a candidate should be hired based on recruitment data.  
Using features such as experience, test scores, and interview performance, we apply classification algorithms to make informed hiring predictions.
